# Practical Project Specification

## Music Database

### Introduction

**Why are we doing this?**

To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training, specifically, to create a Spring Boot API using:

* an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
* a managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider (e.g. H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
* a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)

**How I expected the challenge to go**

I knew the challenge would be difficult as this was the first time I had done a project like this.

**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**

The initial project structure was fairly simple to create and went as planned, as did the Postman CRUD requests. The testing didnâ€™t go as well as planned and it took some time to create the necessary tests to get a benchmark score above 80%.

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project**

Better pre code planning and use of boards to follow a set build, test and implementation structure.
